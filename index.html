<h1>#PayToSpeak</h1>

Conferences give stage to speakers. Very few conferences pay their speakers. Instead, many conferences make their speakers 
#PayToSpeak through not covering the direct costs speaking at their conference incurs for the speaker. 
<p>

We believe that #PayToSpeak lowers quality of conferences in a few ways:
<ul>
<li> Experienced speakers choose not to pay to speak and are not available for #PayToSpeak conferences </li>
<li> New voices cannot afford to make themselves available to conferences, especially in underrepresented groups and underrepresented speaker origin locations</li>
  <li> Likelihood of commercially motivated contents (sales over practitioner talks) increases </li>
  </ul>
<p>
Conferences choose how they frame payment policies. We believe audiences should be informed on which conferences are #PayToSpeak and make choices with their money to support ones that are not #PayToSpeak.
